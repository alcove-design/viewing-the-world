# viewing-the-world

Personal knowledge base about blender and the 3D world.

Studying the 3D creation suite [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is teaching me a lot not only about generating digital content, but also about physics, vision and photography.

This repository is used to keep track of the learnings.

Status: just getting started.


## Where to learn

I somehow got started using youtube videos, even though I usually prefer other medium to follow lessons. It's actually going very well.

Andrew Price - aka Blender Guru - is just amazing. He shares his experience openly, has a broad visual arts culture, provides very relevant and precise information, and the flow of his youtube videos is perfect. Strongly recommended.

Find him on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewPPrice) and on [his website](blenderguru.com).

[Blender fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLa1F2ddGya_-UvuAqHAksYnB0qL9yWDO6&v=MF1qEhBSfq4) might also be a good source of information.
